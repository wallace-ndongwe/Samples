Work covers both the backend and frontend requirements of the task. 

With more time would have increased BE and FE test coverage.

Cors settings would be moved into configuration.

I would have preferred to write the BE tests as functional tests that actually call the endpoints if i had more time.

I used the csvhelper library (https://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/) to parse data from csv files into entities. 
With more time would have stored the data in a database and created a separate project where the data would be accessed via an ORM.
