Work covers both the backend and frontend requirements of the task. 

Both Clinics and Patients data is handled in the same component; with more time would have split the clinic patients
into a child component. Would also have increased test coverage.

Cors settings would be moved into configuration.

I would have preferred to write the tests as functional tests that actually call the endpoints if i had more time. 
I was hampered by lack of a startup class in the scaffolded code, which made this more challenging and i reverted to 
unit tests.

I used the csvhelper library (https://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/) to parse data from csv into objects. 
With more time would have moved the csv files into a separate data project where the parsing would be done, like an ORM.
I would have also split out the csvhelper map classes into separate files and made the maps configurable, as well as 
the file names.

I would also have placed code under a src folder in github
